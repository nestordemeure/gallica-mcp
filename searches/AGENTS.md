## Search

* Searches should be done using the Gallica MCP.
* Always combine queries (with AND, OR, NOT, and exact phrases "...") when possible, instead of running several queries.
* Use parentheses to group complex queries: `(A OR B) AND C`.
* Do not hesitate to do subsequent searches as you realize that new keywords might be worth exploring.
* Searches should be exhaustive: not skipping pages or focusing only on what appear to be the few most relevant hits.

## Download and Reading

* Downloaded files are cached locally and are very large (100KB-1MB+ of text).
* DO NOT read entire files - use Read tool with offset/limit to access specific portions.
* Use tools to search within downloaded files for specific terms.
* If downloading/reading many OCR pages, use tasks/subagents to minimize context use when possible.

## Report

* Reports should be factual, not interpretative.
* References should contain URLs to sources when possible, formatted as `<url>` or `[url name](url)`.
* If writing a report, it should be a Markdown file, with a relevant name, in the `./reports` subfolder.
